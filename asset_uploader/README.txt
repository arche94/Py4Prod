### PYTHON FOR PRODUCTION - WEEK 03

## CODE

You can find the code for this week assignment on my GitHub at: 

https://github.com/arche94/houdini-utils/tree/otls

## RESULT

Along with this file there is an "assetlib.json" file which is the file where I'm storing the uploaded assets information, including the link obtained by Dropbox.
For the purpose of this week's assignment, I uploaded one simple geometry, which you should be able to access with the sharing link.

## NOTES

For security reasons the "config.yaml" file that is on GitHub is incomplete: it's missing the keys necessary to connect to my Dropbox cloud.
